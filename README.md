# PACE

Code to format and analyze MR and Dose data for 5 fraction prostate patients. Includes conversion to nifti for use in Vesela's segmentation code, resampling the dose cube to the imaging data, and computation of dose statistics. 

Main part of code is multi-class segmentation using 2D U-Net. I used the code from Apeer on github (see linke below) as a boiler plate.
